"""ISCE3_Burst's background executor died instantly under pytest/Jupyter.

Fixed in:   unreleased
Symptom:    `insarhub processor -N ISCE3_Burst submit` appeared to start, then
            nothing ran. All stages sat at RUNNING forever and executor.log held
            only:

                [executor] local run failed: fileno
                io.UnsupportedOperation: fileno

            The analyzer then failed with "no unwrapped interferograms ... run
            the processor's 'unwrap' stage first", which points at the analyzer
            and not at the executor that never started.
Root cause: _start_local_background() forks, then redirects the child's output
            with os.dup2(_lf.fileno(), sys.stdout.fileno()). `sys.stdout` is
            only a real file when nothing has replaced it; the moment something
            has -- pytest's capture, Jupyter/Colab, or contextlib.redirect_stdout
            -- .fileno() raises io.UnsupportedOperation. That fired inside the
            forked child before any stage ran.

The fix is to dup2 onto the raw descriptors 1 and 2. In the child those are
still the inherited stdout/stderr whatever the Python-level objects point at.

The same pattern was present in ISCE2_Base and GMTSAR_S1 (10 call sites in
total) and was fixed everywhere, not just where it had been observed.
