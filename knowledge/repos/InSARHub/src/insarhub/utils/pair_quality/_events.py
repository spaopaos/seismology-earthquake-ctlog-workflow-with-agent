Pair quality as a list of events, not a score.

What this replaces
------------------
The old model computed a weighted 0-100 number and cut it into good / risky /
bad at two thresholds.  That number was not interpretable: a pair scored 47
because of some combination of a dozen weighted terms, and nothing in the
output said which.  Worse, the weights implied a precision the inputs do not
support — several of them were multiplied by features that were permanently
``None``, so the arithmetic ran but contributed nothing.

This module asks a different question: **did anything extreme happen during
either acquisition?**  A pair is flagged ``concern`` when at least one
*serious* event is detected, and is ``healthy`` otherwise.  There is deliberately no third label —
"bad" implied a confidence about unusable data that environmental proxies
cannot support.  Every event carries the measurement that triggered it, so the
answer is always traceable to a number a user can check.

What counts as extreme
----------------------
Thresholds below are grounded in the C-band literature where the literature
actually commits to one, and calibrated against the data otherwise.  Each
constant carries its justification.  Where no canonical threshold exists —
notably soil moisture and rainfall — the detector uses the *distribution of
the stack's own AOI* rather than inventing a universal number, because the
same absolute change means very different things in different climates (see
:func:`calibrate`).

Severity
--------
``serious`` — mechanisms that collapse C-band coherence outright.
``minor``   — mechanisms that degrade it or that are proxies with known
              false-positive rates.  Recorded and displayed, but a pair made
              only of minor events stays ``healthy``.

Units, which are not uniform and have bitten this code before
-------------------------------------------------------------
``snow_depth`` m · ``snowfall`` cm · ``rain``/``precip`` mm ·
``soil_moisture`` m³/m³ · ``temp``/``soil_temp`` °C · ``wind_gust`` km/h

# Wet snow. The canonical C-band detector is a 3 dB backscatter drop relative
# to a dry-snow reference (Nagler & Rott 2000, IEEE TGRS 38(2):754-765): liquid
# water raises the dielectric loss so far that penetration collapses from
# metres to a few centimetres. Backscatter is not available here, so the
# trigger is the condition that produces it — snow on the ground with the
# surface at or above freezing. This is the single most destructive C-band
# mechanism, hence serious at a low depth threshold.
WET_SNOW_MIN_DEPTH_M   = 0.01    # 1 cm — enough to dominate the return
WET_SNOW_MIN_TEMP_C    = 0.0

# Dry snow. C-band penetrates dry snow well — a deep, unchanged pack is a
# stable target — so depth alone is a much weaker signal than wetness. It is
# recorded as minor: what actually costs coherence is liquid water (wet_snow)
# or the pack changing between the acquisitions (delta_snow), not how deep the
# snow is. Volume scattering from coarse grains/depth hoar in a deep pack is
# real but secondary, and grain size is not something this model can see.
DEEP_SNOW_M            = 0.25    # 25 cm
# Fresh snowfall resurfaces the scene between passes. Minor: a light dusting
# frequently leaves coherence intact.
FRESH_SNOWFALL_CM      = 1.0

# Snow depth CHANGE between the two acquisitions — a different question from
# how much snow is lying on either date. A pack that is deep but unchanged is
# comparatively benign (it is the same surface twice); a pack that grew or
# melted between passes is not.
#
# The scale comes from the InSAR SWE literature, which reads the same physics
# from the other side: dry snow adds a path delay proportional to SWE, and for
# C-band Sentinel-1 the ΔSWE ambiguity — one full 2-pi phase cycle — is
# 1.5-3.5 cm depending on incidence angle (Snow water equivalent retrieval over
# Idaho Part 1, The Cryosphere 18:559, 2024, which also accepts pixels only
# above gamma 0.35). Below one ambiguity the change is recoverable signal;
# beyond it the phase aliases, and where the accumulation is spatially uneven
# the pair decorrelates outright — the same work reports that "snowstorms
# reduce the temporal coherence significantly".
#
# ERA5 gives depth, not SWE, and Open-Meteo's snow_depth_water_equivalent is
# accepted by the API but returns all nulls with unit "undefined", so the
# conversion is done here with a bulk seasonal-snowpack density. 300 kg/m3 is
# mid-range for a settled pack (fresh 50-150, settled 200-400, ripe 350-500),
# which puts one C-band ambiguity at roughly 5-12 cm of depth.
DELTA_SNOW_SERIOUS_M = 0.10   # ~3 cm SWE at 300 kg/m3 — a full ambiguity
DELTA_SNOW_MINOR_M   = 0.05   # ~1.5 cm SWE — the low end of the ambiguity
SNOW_DENSITY_KGM3    = 300.0

# Freeze/thaw. Soil permittivity falls from ~15-25 to ~4-5 on freezing, and
# C-band is strongly sensitive to that transition (Rignot & Way 1994, RSE;
# corroborated by later Sentinel-1 freeze/thaw work). The state change between
# the two acquisitions is what matters, not the absolute temperature.
FREEZE_THAW_C          = 0.0

# Wind. Canopy motion decorrelates vegetated scenes between passes. No
# canonical C-band threshold exists, so this is set from the data: the variable
# is a DAILY MAXIMUM gust, which is much higher than a typical wind speed, and
# a first attempt at 40 km/h (Beaufort 6) turned out to be near the median —
# it fired on 63%/54%/41% of days at three test sites and appeared on almost
# every pair, which makes an event worthless. 70 km/h (Beaufort 8, gale) fires
# on 6%/2%/3% of days at the same three, rare and consistent across climates.
# Minor regardless: it is a proxy for a mechanism that only bites over tall
# vegetation, which this module cannot see now that land cover is not fetched.

# MintPy time-series inversion is commonly run at 0.4, land-cover-adaptive
# schemes use 0.35-0.45, and network selection floors sit near 0.12. A pair
# the decay curve already predicts below the inversion floor is flagged
# regardless of weather — nothing that happens on the day will rescue it.

# Rain and soil moisture have NO canonical C-band threshold in the literature
# — the searches that turned up 3 dB for wet snow and 0 degC for freeze/thaw
# return only qualitative statements for these two ("precipitation events
# affect soil moisture, which affects coherence"). Fixed millimetre and
# m³/m³ cut-offs would therefore be invented, and measurably climate-biased:
# a 12-day soil-moisture change of 0.10 m³/m³ occurs in 6% of summer pairs in
# semi-arid Utah and 42% in Iowa cropland. So these two are calibrated per AOI
# from the stack's own distribution — see calibrate(). The fallbacks below are
# used only when a stack is too short to calibrate against.
#
# What "heavy_rain" means here, since the name invites a meteorological reading:
# it is NOT the WMO classification. WMO grades intensity per hour (heavy =
# 7.6-50 mm/h) and daily totals put "heavy" at roughly 31-70 mm/day. Those
# describe how the rain felt; what matters to C-band is whether enough water
# reached the surface to change its dielectric and roughness between two
# passes, which is a lower bar and strongly place-dependent. Calibration
# against real AOIs bears that out — the p97 of 3-day rain came to 9 mm at a
# semi-arid Utah site, 21 mm in Iowa, 23 mm in the Netherlands and 83 mm in
# monsoon Kerala. A single WMO-derived constant would be silent in three of
# those four places.
#
# The event is not redundant with soil_moisture_change either: measured over
# 435 pairs per site, heavy_rain alone flagged 16 (Utah), 29 (Iowa), 29 (NL)
# and 19 (Kerala) pairs that the soil-moisture rule did not — rain also ponds,
# wets canopy and redistributes surface material, none of which shows up as a
# 0-7 cm moisture step.
