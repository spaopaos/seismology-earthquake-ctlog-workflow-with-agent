"""NISAR L2 GSLC (geocoded SLC) search + download via ASF.

GSLC is already geocoded, so it feeds dolphin phase-linking directly through the
ISCE3_NISAR processor -- there is no coregistration/geocoding step and no orbit
download (NISAR products carry their own state vectors). Everything else (search,
grouping by path/frame, download, pair selection, footprint) comes from
``ASF_Base_Downloader``.
