"""Sentinel-1 SLC-BURST downloader.

ASF distributes individual TOPS bursts as their own granules (dataset
``SLC-BURST``). A burst is roughly 1/9th of a full IW slice, so an AOI-limited
stack pulls far less data than the equivalent SLC search -- that is the entire
point of burst-based processing, and what makes the ISCE3/COMPASS workflow
practical over a small target area.

Bursts on their own are not consumable by SAFE-expecting tools, so
:meth:`S1_Burst.download` hands the selected granules to ``burst2safe``, which
assembles them into valid ``.SAFE`` directories -- merging the annotation,
calibration and noise XML and writing a manifest.

Relationship to the ``burst2stack`` CLI
---------------------------------------
The COMPASS notebook drives this as::

    burst2stack --rel-orbit 124 --pols VV --swaths IW2 IW3 \
                --start-date ... --end-date ... --extent W S E N --output-dir ...

which performs its *own* ASF search internally. This class instead reuses
:class:`ASF_Base_Downloader`'s search, so ``search`` -> ``filter`` -> ``summary``
-> ``footprint`` -> ``select_pairs`` all behave exactly as they do for
``S1_SLC``, and only the already-filtered granule list is passed to
``burst2safe(granules=...)``. One search, and the filters the user applied are
the ones that govern what gets assembled.

        Why this override exists: ASF publishes NO baseline metadata for
        SLC-BURST products -- ``perpendicularBaseline``, ``temporalBaseline``
        and ``insarStackId`` are all None -- so the inherited implementation
        (which reads state vectors / baselines off each product) selects
        against data that does not exist. Measured on a 9-date Hawaii stack:
        the naive path returned 16 pairs instead of 21, silently dropping two
        12-day pairs (the highest-coherence ones) and leaving the final date
        with "0 / 3 connections available".

        The burst-native path in :func:`insarhub.utils.select_pairs` treats
        each acquisition **date** as the pairing node (one date = one stitched
        SAFE after burst2safe): temporal baseline comes from the burst's
        ``startTime`` and perpendicular baseline from per-date orbit state
        vectors (assembled ``.SAFE`` annotation, local ``.EOF``, or POEORB by
        date+mission). No parent-SLC lookup is performed.

        Returns:
            The base implementation's structure, with scene names replaced by
            ``YYYYMMDD`` acquisition dates -- the identifier that is meaningful
            for a burst stack (a date has many bursts, so no single burst
            granule can stand for it).
