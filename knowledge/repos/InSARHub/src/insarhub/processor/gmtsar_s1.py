GMTSAR_S1 — Sentinel-1 InSAR processor backed by GMTSAR's Python
p2p_processing / p2p_S1_TOPS_Frame pipelines.

STATUS: v4, fused HPC stages + topo precompute (2026-07-28) -- align_F<N>/
topo_F<N>/intf_F<N> collapsed into single "align"/"topo"/"intf" stages, each
one manager whose sliding window fans out across every subswath (and, for
intf, every pair within each subswath) as concurrent child jobs, instead of
one manager per subswath chained strictly sequentially -- align_F<N>/
topo_F<N> have no data dependency on each other, so there was no reason to
force them through a single-file-of-work chain. Also added the "topo" stage
itself: previously each intf pair recomputed topo_ra.grd from scratch
(intf_tops.csh's Stage 1), which is unsafe under any pair concurrency --
Stage 1 starts with `cleanup.csh topo`, deleting whatever a concurrently-
running pair is still using -- confirmed as a real failure cause on a live
run ("No datapoints inside region" from an empty, torn trans.dat). GMTSAR's
own intf_tops_parallel.csh has this identical bug. Now topo_ra.grd is
computed exactly once per subswath before any pair's intf starts; see
run_stage_unit()/_run_topo_unit()'s docstrings.

STATUS: v3, frame_mode dropped (2026-07-27) -- single- vs multi-subswath
dispatch is now inferred from whether config.subswath names one IW or
several (see _multiswath), instead of a separate frame_mode bool. It was
purely redundant: p2p_S1_TOPS_Frame doesn't take a subswath argument at
all (always processes every subswath present), so frame_mode only ever
encoded "does subswath name one value or all of them" -- information
subswath's own shape already carries, the same way stack_mode's own
multi-subswath handling already worked.

STATUS: v2, unified pairs signature (2026-07-21). Both modes now take the
same pairs = [(ref_safe, ref_eof, sec_safe, sec_eof), ...] shape -- raw
.SAFE + .EOF names, nothing more. v1 required single-subswath callers to
hand-derive raw per-subswath product stems themselves; that was correct
per GMTSAR's own CLI contract but bad UX and untested against real data.
Real end-to-end validation (multi-subswath Frame mode, see
docs/gmtsar_s1_notes/OPEN_ISSUES.md) confirmed the pipeline genuinely
works; this revision closes the remaining gap by having GMTSAR_S1 itself
do the single-subswath extraction that single-subswath mode needs.

Two distinct GMTSAR entry points, selected by whether config.subswath
names one IW or several (_multiswath):

  Single subswath (e.g. subswath="2") -- via p2p_processing.
    p2p_processing does not read .SAFE directories itself -- it expects
    one subswath's .tiff/.xml already extracted to matching-stem files
    in raw/ (confirmed against p2p_processing's own usage string, AND
    independently against GMTSAR's bundled single-subswath test fixture,
    H_res/raw/: its per-stem .tiff/.xml/.EOF files are plain symlinks
    into the equivalent Frame-mode F<N>/raw/ subswath files pulled from
    the same .SAFE). GMTSAR_S1._extract_subswath_stem() reproduces that
    extraction (glob measurement/annotation for config.subswath +
    config.polarization, symlink the matching .EOF under the same stem)
    so callers only ever pass raw .SAFE/.EOF names, same as Frame mode:
        p2p_processing S1_TOPS \
          s1a-iw2-slc-vv-20190704t135158-20190704t135223-027968-032877-005 \
          s1a-iw2-slc-vv-20190716t135159-20190716t135224-028143-032dc3-005 \
          config.py
    One shared case_dir for the whole pairs list -- p2p_processing's own
    output (intf/<julian_date_pair>/, e.g. intf/2019184_2019196/ --
    GMTSAR's own Julian-date naming, NOT ref/sec stems, confirmed via a
    real run + real MintPy testing) is pair-namespaced, so
    concurrent pairs don't collide.

  Multiple subswaths (e.g. subswath="1 2 3", the default) -- multi-subswath
    Frame, via p2p_S1_TOPS_Frame, which always processes every subswath
    present (it takes no subswath argument itself).
    pairs = [(ref_safe, ref_eof, sec_safe, sec_eof), ...] -- .SAFE
    directory names + matching .EOF orbit filenames (confirmed against
    gmtsar/python/utils/p2p_S1_TOPS_Frame's own usage string and a real
    recipe, tests/recipes/README_S1A_SLC_TOPS_LA.txt):
        p2p_S1_TOPS_Frame Master.SAFE Master.EOF Aligned.SAFE Aligned.EOF \
          config.py vv 1
    p2p_S1_TOPS_Frame is NOT pair-namespaced -- it always writes
    F1/F2/F3/merge/ into its current working directory (confirmed by
    tracing the script: no per-pair subdirectory logic exists). So each
    pair gets its OWN case subdirectory (case_dir/<ref>_<sec>/), not a
    shared one -- otherwise pair 2 would silently overwrite pair 1's
    merge/ output.

Interface mirrors ISCE2_S1 / Hyp3_S1:
  submit()  -- stage case dir(s), launch the right GMTSAR entry point per
               pair (subprocess), up to max_workers concurrent.
  refresh() -- read per-pair status, print a table.
  retry()   -- re-run failed pairs (and only failed pairs).
  watch()   -- poll until every pair is SUCCEEDED or FAILED.
  save()    -- persist gmtsar_jobs.json, matching ISCE2_S1's isce_jobs.json.

Why no custom output-normalization step (single-subswath mode only -- see
KNOWN GAP below for multi-subswath mode): GMTSAR's native per-pair output
directory (intf/<julian_date_pair>/ -- e.g. intf/2019184_2019196/,
GMTSAR's own Julian-date pair naming derived from each SLC's
SC_clock_start, NOT the ref/sec stems passed on the CLI -- confirmed
via a real run + reading intf/'s actual contents; the ref_stem_sec_stem
name this docstring used to claim was wrong, found via real MintPy
integration testing 2026-07-21) contains corr_ll.grd, phasefilt_ll.grd,
and *.PRM files, matching what MintPy's own prep_gmtsar.py expects
(confirmed by reading mintpy/prep_gmtsar.py directly: it globs
`{fbase}_ll*.grd` and `*.PRM`, and derives DATE12 from the Julian-date
directory basename itself, so GMTSAR's naming is not just compatible --
prep_gmtsar.py actually requires it). GMTSAR_S1 discovers the real
directory post-run (_run_one_pair()) rather than assuming a name.
KNOWN GAP: multi-subswath mode's real output lands in merge/ with the same
file basenames but has NOT been checked against prep_gmtsar.py's
directory-discovery logic -- needs a real Frame-mode run + a
prep_gmtsar.py dry run before that claim can be made for Frame mode too.

Deliberately kept as a subprocess-per-pair design, not in-process Python
calls into GMTSAR's own p2p_stages.py: (1) InSARHub and GMTSAR run in
separate conda environments with different numpy/GDAL stacks -- importing
GMTSAR's stage code in-process risks real dependency collisions; (2) most
wall-clock is spent in C binaries (gmt, snaphu) either way, so in-process
Python orchestration wouldn't meaningfully speed anything up; (3) this
matches both ISCE2_S1's own external-process pattern AND GMTSAR's own test
harness (case_runner.py), which deliberately runs each case in its own
subprocess for process-group isolation.

        super-master in one step, so a scene 144 days out has its azimuth
        misregistration measured directly across 144 days -- where the
        burst-overlap ESD estimate is unreliable. The residual shows up as
        phase steps at burst boundaries that grow with distance from the
        master. Measured on p100_f466: p2p (12-day master) is clean, while
        both the InSARHub stack AND a tutorial-exact stock-GMTSAR run
        (master 120+ days out) show ~20 burst discontinuities at 11-13x
        background. ESD on/off and decimation were controlled and excluded
        -- it is the single-pass topology, not the settings.

        This stage measures a SHORT-baseline network instead (12-48 days,
        where ESD is reliable) and inverts it for per-date corrections, the
        way ISCE topsStack's run_07_pairs_misreg + run_08_timeseries_misreg
        do. ISCE holds ~0.0005 px residual flat from 12 to 144 days out on
        this same stack, with the same master.

        Measurement is GMTSAR's own spectral_diversity, and the correction
        is applied exactly where preproc_batch_tops_esd.csh applies its own
        (grdmath onto the azimuth shift table, then make_s1a_tops mode 1),
        so everything downstream is untouched.

        REAL BUG FOUND via a p100_f466_gmtsar HPC run: Stage 1 depends only
        on the fixed super-master image + DEM (batch_tops.config's
        master_image, identical for every pair in this swath) -- it has
        nothing to do with which pair triggered it, and _run_intf_unit()
        used to call intf_tops.csh (both stages) once per pair. Stage 1
        starts with `cleanup.csh topo` (wipes topo/ except dem.grd), so two
        pairs' Stage 1 overlapping in time -- inherent once more than 1 pair
        runs concurrently -- means one pair's cleanup can delete topo/
        files another pair is actively reading/writing mid-computation.
        Confirmed as the actual cause of a "No datapoints inside region,
        aborting" / empty trans.dat failure in a real run (GMTSAR's own
        intf_tops_parallel.csh -- the upstream "run intf in parallel" wrapper
        -- has this identical bug, it just fans out intf_tops.csh under GNU
        parallel with no isolation for the shared topo/ dir either).

        Once this succeeds, _run_intf_unit() always requests Stage 2 only
        (see _config_with_stage) -- it never touches topo/ for writes again,
        only reads topo_ra.grd/trans.dat, so every pair is safe to run with

        binary, which is NOT provided by GMTSAR's own bin/ directory --
        it comes from the conda environment GMTSAR was installed into
        (conda-forge's gmt package). InSARHub runs in its OWN separate
        conda environment (different numpy/GDAL stack, deliberately --
        see this module's docstring), which does not have `gmt` on PATH
        at all. Confirmed directly: `which gmt` inside InSARHub's env
        returns nothing; dem2topo_ra then fails in ~1s (not the tens of
        seconds a real DEM interpolation takes) because the `gmt`
        subprocess it shells out to doesn't exist.

        So this can't rely on inheriting the caller's PATH -- it must

        own scripts) and gmtsar_env_bin (the conda env providing `gmt`,
