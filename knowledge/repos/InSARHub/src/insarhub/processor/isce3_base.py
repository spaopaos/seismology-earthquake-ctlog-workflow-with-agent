"""Shared infrastructure for ISCE3 + COMPASS local processors.

``ISCE3_Base`` is the ISCE3-side analogue of :mod:`insarhub.processor.isce2_base`
(which serves ISCE2's stackSentinel processors) and ``Hyp3Base`` (the cloud
side): it carries the machinery every ISCE3/COMPASS processor needs -- the
isce3 conda env discovery, the per-stage status-marker convention, the
detached-background stage runner, and job persistence -- so a concrete processor like
:class:`~insarhub.processor.ISCE3_Burst` (and later an ISCE3_NISAR variant)
only implements its own stages.

Status bookkeeping mirrors GMTSAR_S1's ``.stack_status`` marker convention
rather than ISCE2_Base's ``.status`` files: one directory per stage under
``workdir/.stage_status/`` holding a ``.succeeded`` or ``.failed`` marker, so
each stage can be inspected, deleted and re-run on its own.

A subclass declares its stage order via ``STAGES``, marks any not-yet-
implemented stage by leaving it out of ``_IMPLEMENTED``, and implements one
``run_<stage>(self, force=False) -> bool`` method per implemented stage; the
base ``submit()`` discovers them by name. Imports of isce3/COMPASS/dolphin
stay deferred inside the stage methods on purpose -- those live in their own
conda env, not necessarily the one InSARHub runs from -- so this module (and
``import insarhub``) must not import them at module scope.
