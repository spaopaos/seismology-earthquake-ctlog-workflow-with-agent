# Web UI

InSARHub includes a built-in web interface that lets you run the full InSAR workflow from a browser — no Python scripting required.

## Launch

After installing InSARHub, start the web server with:

```bash
insarhub-app
```

Then open **[http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)** in your browser.

Options:

```bash
insarhub-app -w /data/bryce    # set working directory
insarhub-app --host 0.0.0.0   # expose to your local network
insarhub-app --port 9090       # change port
insarhub-app --version         # print version and exit
```

The `-w` / `--workdir` flag pre-sets the working directory so you do not need to configure it in the Settings panel after launch. If omitted, the directory where you run `insarhub-app` is used.

## Running on HPC

InSARHub backend is hosted by FastAPI which allows running backend on HPC and use port forwarding to open the frontend on you local machine. 

**Steps:**

1. Install the [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) extension in VS Code
2. Connect to your HPC login node: **Connect to Host → + → `user@hpc.example.edu`**
3. Open a terminal in VS Code (now running on the HPC) and start InSARHub:
   ```bash
   insarhub-app -w /your/hpc/workdir
   ```
4. VS Code detects the open port and offers to forward it — click **Open in Browser**, or manually add port `8080` under **Ports** tab
5. Open **[http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)** in your local browser

The UI runs locally in your browser; all data, processing, and file I/O happen on the HPC node.

!!! tip "Submit node vs login node"
    When start `insarhub-app` on a login node. We recommend to use **HPC mode** in the Processor and Analyzer panels to submit processing steps as `sbatch` jobs to the cluster. Or you may causing admin ban due to stress of login cluster.

## Settings

Click the ⚙ Settings button to configure:

- **General** — working directory, download workers
- **Auth** — Earthdata and CDSE credentials
- **Downloader** — downloader type and parameters
- **Processor** — processor type and parameters
- **Analyzer** — per-analyzer config (each analyzer type stores its own settings independently)

## Job Folders

Click **Jobs** to open the Job Folders drawer. InSARHub scans your working directory and lists all subfolders that contain recognized workflow files.

Each folder shows clickable role tags:

| Tag | What it means |
|-----|---------------|
| **Downloader** | Folder has a `downloader_config.json` |
| **Processor** | Folder has a `hyp3_jobs.json` |
| **Analyzer** | Folder has a `mintpy.cfg` |

Click a tag to open that role's panel. Click 🗑 to delete the entire job folder.
