## Welcome to InSARHub ! :tada:
InSARHub is an open-source package designed to support the full InSAR processing pipeline.
The primary goal of this package is to provide a streamlined and user-friendly InSAR processing experience across multiple satellite products, from data search and download through time-series analysis — all accessible via a modern web UI or the command line.
