# Real end-to-end pipeline: ISCE2/topsStack -> MintPy, against real infrastructure.
#
# Runs the actual insarhub CLI with no mocking of any kind:
#   - downloads real Sentinel-1 SLC scenes (~4GB each)
#   - runs real ISCE2 stackSentinel processing for every real selected pair
#   - runs ISCE2_Mintpy_SBAS.prep_data() for real (real path discovery)
#   - runs the real MintPy time-series workflow
#
# By default this operates on p100_f466_isce/ (repo root) — a real S1 SLC
# stack (path 100 / frame 466), kept separate from cli_e2e_hyp3_mintpy.sh's
# default p100_f466/ workdir: Hyp3_Mintpy_SBAS and ISCE2_Mintpy_SBAS derive their MintPy
# output directory purely from workdir (workdir/mintpy/, with no
# analyzer-type awareness — see MintPyPaths in config/paths.py), so running
# both e2e tests against the same workdir would silently overwrite one
# pipeline's mintpy/ outputs (ifgramStack.h5, smallbaselineApp.cfg,
# velocity.h5, etc.) with the other's.
#
# Prerequisites
# -------------
#   - ~/.netrc (or ~/.credit_pool) with Earthdata credentials.
#   - A real ISCE2 + topsStack install. Build the base env from this repo's
#     environment.yml, then add ISCE2 into the same env:
#       mamba env create -f environment.yml -n insarhub_isce
#       conda activate insarhub_isce
#       mamba install -c conda-forge "numpy<2.0" isce2
#       pip install -e .
#   - Disk space: ~50GB+ for the 13 real SLCs, plus processing intermediates
#     (unpacked bursts, coregistered stacks, interferograms) — check with
#     `df -h` before starting; this can require several hundred GB for a
#     27-pair stack.
#   - Time: real ISCE2 stackSentinel processing of 27 pairs on a single
#     (non-HPC) machine can take many hours to multiple days. Pass
#     --hpc-mode (after configuring sbatch_options.json — see
#     `insarhub processor -N ISCE2_S1 --hpc-mode -w <workdir> submit` docs)
#     if a SLURM cluster is available instead.
#   - (optional) ~/.cdsapirc — see cli_e2e_hyp3_mintpy.sh for why.
#
# Usage (run from the repo root, so the [workdir] default resolves correctly)
# -----
#   conda activate insarhub_isce
#   bash test/e2e/cli_e2e_isce_mintpy.sh [workdir]
#
# Safe to re-run: SLC download skips files that already exist and match the
# expected size; ISCE2_S1.submit() skips any run-file step already marked
# SUCCEEDED (skip_existing, on by default) — so re-running this script after
# a partial/interrupted run resumes rather than restarting from scratch.

# Anchor the default workdir to the real repo-root p100_f466_isce/ regardless of
